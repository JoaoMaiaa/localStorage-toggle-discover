                        <p class="has-text-weight-bold ">For over 125 years [01], we’ve been bringing people together. 
                            Today, we’d like people to come together on something that 
                            concerns all of us: obesity. The long term health of our families 
                            and the country is at stake [02]. And as the nation’s leading 
                            beverage company, we can play an important role [03].Across our
                            portfolio of more than 650 beverages, we now offer over 180 low 
                            and no-calorie choices. And most of our full calorie beverages now 
                            have low or no calorie versions.
                            Over the last 15 years, this has helped to reduce the average calories per 
                            serving across our industry’s products in 
                            the US by about 22%. We’ve created smaller-portion controled sizes for our 
                            most popular drinks and will have them in about 90% of the country by the end 
                            of this year [04].

                            We’ve added the calorie content of all our beverages on the front, to 
                            help make it even easier for people to make informed decisions. For elementary,
                             middle, and high schools our industry has voluntarily changed its offerings to
                            primarily waters, juices, and low and no-calorie options. This has helped to 
                            reduce the calories from our industry’s beverages in those schools by 90% since
                            2004.
